# Purpose

This repository holds my own solutions to the puzzles provided on [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/).

## Structure

- Solutions are organized by Year. Each year has its own folder.
- Inside each year's folder, scripts are named following thois convention: `Day X[.Y].ext`; where:
  - `X` is the number of the day (e.g. A number between 1 and 24)
  - `Y` is the number of the part of the challenge (e.g. 1, 2 or more)
  - `ext` is the file extension corresponding to the chosen language (e.g. `php`,`ps1`,`sh`,`c`)

By Example:
`/2024/Day3.1.ps1` is my solution for to the first (`1`) part of puzzle of the third (`3`) day of this year's advent of code issue (`2024`). This solution is written in powershell (`ps1`).
